# Volumes
In this section, we will learn about Docker volumes, which are a way to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers. Volumes allow you to store data outside of the container's filesystem, making it easier to manage and share data between containers.


## CRUD operations with volumes
1. Create a volume named "my_volume":

```bash
docker volume create my_volume
```

2. List all volumes to verify that "my_volume" has been created:

```bash
docker volume ls
```
3. Run a container and mount the volume to a directory inside the container:

```bash
docker run -d --name=container4 -v my_volume:/data ubuntu
```
